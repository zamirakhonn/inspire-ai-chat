Overview

Inspire AI üåø is a backend service that provides an empathetic, supportive AI chat assistant for parents of children with serious mental health conditions. It‚Äôs designed to help parents:

Stay motivated and consistent in daily caregiving.

Track small improvements in the child‚Äôs behavior.

Receive positive reinforcement and micro-guidance.

Use a session-based chat with personalized AI responses.

The AI agent uses OpenAI‚Äôs GPT models with enhanced prompts and a system designed to maximize empathy, positivity, and practical advice.

Features

AI chat with session-based history per user.

Empathy-driven system prompt for consistent tone.

Randomized supportive phrases to avoid repetition.

REST API with Swagger documentation.

User authentication (register/login).

Microservices-ready architecture.

Easily updatable AI logic as you continue fine-tuning.

Architecture

Microservices Ready: The AI chat is structured as a standalone service (ai.py) and can be integrated with other services.

Modules:

services/users.py ‚Üí User authentication and management.

services/ai.py ‚Üí AI response generation with chat history.

app.py ‚Üí Main Flask REST API with namespaces for auth and chat.

Data Flow:

Parent logs in or registers.

Sends a message via POST /chat/.

AI generates empathetic response using GPT API and session-based chat history.

Response returned with timestamp and stored in memory (can later be connected to a database).
